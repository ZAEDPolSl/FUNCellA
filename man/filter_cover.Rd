\title{Filter Pathways by Gene Coverage in Expression Data}
\usage{
filter_cover(X, pathway, filt_cov)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix or data.frame with genes/features as rows and samples as columns.
Row names (gene identifiers) must be provided.}

\item{pathway}{A named list of pathways, where each element is a character vector of gene identifiers.}

\item{filt_cov}{Numeric value between 0 and 1 indicating the minimum fraction of pathway genes
that must be present in \code{X} to include the pathway. Default is 0 (no coverage filtering).}
}
\value{
A list of filtered pathways.
}
\description{
This function filters out pathways from a list based on the fraction of their genes that
are present (mapped) in the expression matrix \code{X}. Only pathways meeting the minimum coverage
threshold \code{filt_cov} are retained.
}
