\title{Thresholding pathway activity scores using k-means clustering}
\usage{
thr_KM(df_path, K = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{df_path}{A numeric matrix or data.frame of pathway activity scores,
where rows correspond to pathways and columns to samples.}

\item{K}{Maximum number of clusters to consider when estimating the optimal
number of clusters using the silhouette method (default: 10).}
}
\value{
A list with:
\itemize{
  \item \code{binary} – matrix of 0/1 assignments (cluster with relatvie pathway activation = 1).
  \item \code{clusters} – matrix of full cluster assignments (1…k).
}
}
\description{
This function applies k-means clustering to threshold pathway activity scores
for each pathway (row) individually. The optimal number of clusters is
estimated using the silhouette method. Samples belonging to the cluster
with the highest mean activity are marked as active (1); all others are marked inactive (0).
