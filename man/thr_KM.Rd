\title{Thresholding pathway activity scores using k-means clustering}
\usage{
thr_KM(df_path, K = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{df_path}{A numeric matrix or data.frame of pathway activity scores,
where rows correspond to pathways and columns to samples.}

\item{K}{Maximum number of clusters to consider when estimating the optimal
number of clusters using the silhouette method (default: 10).}
}
\value{
A binary matrix of the same dimensions as \code{df_path}, where
  values are 1 for samples in the most active cluster per pathway, and 0 otherwise.
}
\description{
This function applies k-means clustering to threshold pathway activity scores
for each pathway (row) individually. The optimal number of clusters is
estimated using the silhouette method. Samples belonging to the cluster
with the highest mean activity are marked as active (1); all others are marked inactive (0).
