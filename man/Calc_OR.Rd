\title{Calculate Odds Ratios for JASMINE Pathway Enrichment}
\source{
\url{https://github.com/NNoureen/JASMINE}
}
\usage{
Calc_OR(X, g_vec)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix or data.frame with genes/features as rows and samples as columns.
Row names (gene identifiers) must be provided.}

\item{g_vec}{Character vector of gene names representing the gene set/pathway.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of odds ratios, one per sample. Higher values indicate stronger
  enrichment of the pathway's genes in the expressed gene set of each sample.
}
\description{
This function computes the odds ratio (OR) for each sample, assessing the enrichment
of a pathway by comparing the presence (non-zero expression) of genes in the pathway
versus those not in the pathway. It is used as an effect size component in the
JASMINE scoring method for single-cell data.
}
\details{
The odds ratio is computed based on the contingency table of expressed vs. non-expressed
genes for both pathway and non-pathway genes. A pseudocount is used to prevent division
by zero in cases with no expression.
