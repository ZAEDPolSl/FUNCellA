\title{Wrapper to JASMINE Pathway Enrichment Scoring Function}
\source{
\url{https://github.com/NNoureen/JASMINE}
}
\usage{
pathJASMINE(X, pathway, type = "oddsratio")
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix or data.frame with genes/features as rows and samples as columns.
Row names (gene identifiers) must be provided.}

\item{pathway}{A named list of pathways, where each element is a character vector of gene identifiers.}

\item{type}{A character string indicating the type of effect size adjustment to use.
Valid options are \code{"oddsratio"} (default) and \code{"likelihood"}.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with pathways as rows and samples as columns containing pathway activity scores.
}
\description{
This function computes pathway enrichment scores using the JASMINE method to the pathway list. The JASMINE is designed for single-cell data.
It integrates a dropout-based gene ranking component with an effect size adjustment using either the odds ratio
(default) or a likelihood-based statistic. The scores are normalized via min-max scaling, and the final score is the
average of the ranking and the effect size components.
}
\details{
The JASMINE score is computed by:
\itemize{
  \item Ranking expressed genes (non-zero) using a dropout-aware strategy.
  \item Calculating an effect size (odds ratio or likelihood) to quantify overrepresentation.
  \item Scaling both components via min-max normalization.
  \item Averaging the two normalized components for the final score.
}
If the effect size cannot be computed (e.g., all values are \code{NA}), the score is based solely on the ranking component.
