\title{Wrapper to Z-score pathway enrichment}
\usage{
pathZScore(X, pathway)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix or data.frame with genes/features as rows and samples as columns.
Row names (gene identifiers) must be provided.}

\item{pathway}{A named list of pathways, where each element is a character vector of gene identifiers.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with pathways as rows and samples as columns containing pathway activity scores.
}
\description{
The Z-score method standardizes gene expression values across samples and
  calculates a combined enrichment score for each gene set using the Stouffer integration of Z scores.
}
\details{
Specifically, for a gene set \eqn{G = \{1, \dots, k\}} with standardized
  expression values \eqn{z_1, \dots, z_k} for a given sample, the combined
  Z-score \eqn{Z_{\G}} is computed as:
  \deqn{
    Z_{\G} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{k} z_i}{\sqrt{k}}
  }

  This approach is based on Lee et al. (2008) and aggregates standardized gene
  expression values to reflect pathway activity while accounting for gene set size. The aggregation itself is known as Stouffer integration method.
