\title{Visualize k-means thresholding results}
\usage{
vis_KM(PR, df_path, thr_km)
}
\arguments{
\item{PR}{A numeric matrix or data.frame with two columns (first and second dimensions
of the reduced space, e.g. PCA, UMAP or t-SNE coordinates).}

\item{df_path}{A numeric matrix or data.frame of pathway activity scores,
where rows correspond to pathways and columns to samples. Row names should correspond to pathway identifiers. Its is output of function gene2path().}

\item{thr_km}{The result of \code{thr_KM()}, containing both binary (0/1) assignments
and full cluster labels.}
}
\value{
A list of length equal to the number of pathways.
Each element is itself a list containing three ggplot2 objects:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{binary} – points colored by binary assignment (0 = non-selected, 1 = selected cluster).
    \item \code{clusters} – points colored by all k-means clusters.
    \item \code{PAS} – scatterplot colored by PAS values.
  }
}
\description{
This function creates visualizations of cluster assignments obtained from
\code{thr_KM()}, highlighting both the binary assignment (0/1 for the cluster
with the highest centroid) and the full k-means clustering.
