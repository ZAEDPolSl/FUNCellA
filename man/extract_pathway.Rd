\title{Function to extract matrix of genes in pathway}
\usage{
extract_pathway(X, g_vec)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix or data.frame with genes/features as rows and samples as columns.
Row names (gene identifiers) must be provided.}

\item{g_vec}{Character vector of gene names representing the gene set/pathway.}
}
\value{
A data.frame containing only the genes in \code{g_vec} that are present in \code{X},
  excluding genes with zero or missing variance.
}
\description{
This function extracts and returns the expression matrix corresponding to genes in a specified pathway.
Genes with zero or undefined variance across samples are removed to ensure informative input
for downstream analysis.
