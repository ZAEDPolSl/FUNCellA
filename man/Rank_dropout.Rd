}
\usage{
Rank_dropout(X, g_vec)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix or data.frame with genes/features as rows and samples as columns.}

\item{g_vec}{Character vector of gene names representing the gene set/pathway.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the average normalized rank of genes in \code{g_vec}
  relative to all non-zero genes in \code{X}.
}
\description{
This function ranks non-zero gene expression values within a sample and calculates
the average normalized rank for a given set of genes (pathway).
It excludes zero counts (dropouts) from ranking to focus on expressed genes.
