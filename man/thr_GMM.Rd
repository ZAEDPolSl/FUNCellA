\title{Threshold selection for pathway activity using GMM decomposition}
\usage{
thr_GMM(gmms)
}
\arguments{
\item{gmms}{A list of GMM decomposition results, where each top-level list element corresponds
to one pathway. Each element should contain:
\describe{
  \item{\code{threshold}}{A numeric vector of threshold values derived from the GMM.}
  \item{\code{model}}{A matrix of GMM parameters (e.g., means, variances and alphas for each component).}
}}
}
\value{
A named list of thresholding results per pathway. For each pathway, a sublist is returned with:
  \describe{
    \item{\code{Kmeans_thr}}{Threshold selected based on k-means clustering of GMM parameters.}
    \item{\code{Top1_thr}}{Top threshold (maximum of the available thresholds).}
    \item{\code{All_thr}}{All threshold values derived from the GMM.}
  }
}
\description{
This function selects thresholds indicating samples with relatively high pathway activity
based on Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) decomposition. It processes GMM output from the
\code{dpGMM} package or the \code{GMMdecomp} function, extracting thresholds using different
strategies, including maximum threshold (Top1) and optional k-means-based refinement.
