\title{Visualize Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering results}
\usage{
vis_GMM(PR, df_path, res_gmm, thr_method = "KM")
}
\arguments{
\item{PR}{A numeric matrix or data.frame with two columns (first and second dimensions
of the reduced space, e.g. PCA, UMAP or t-SNE coordinates).}

\item{df_path}{A numeric matrix or data.frame of pathway activity scores,
where rows correspond to pathways and columns to samples. Row names should correspond to pathway identifiers. Its is output of function gene2path().}

\item{res_gmm}{A list of GMM results, one per pathway,
each containing at least:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{cluster} – vector of cluster assignments per sample,
    \item \code{KS} – number of clusters,
    \item \code{fig} – a ggplot object representing the fitted GMM distribution.
  }
Output of GMMdecomp() function is valid.}

\item{thr_method}{Character string, thresholding method for cluster significance.
Must be one of:
  \itemize{
    \item `"KM"` – use GMM with k-means threshold,
    \item `"Top1"` – use GMM Top-1 threshold.
  }
Default is `"KM"`.}
}
\value{
A list of length equal to the number of pathways (`nrow(df_path)`).
Each element is itself a list with three ggplot objects:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{clusters} – scatterplot colored by cluster assignment.
    \item \code{PAS} – scatterplot colored by PAS values.
    \item \code{gmm} – fitted GMM distribution with threshold line.
  }
}
\description{
This function generates visualizations of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering
applied to pathway-level data. For each pathway (row in `df_path`), three plots
are returned: (1) points colored by GMM cluster assignment,
(2) points colored by pathway activity score (PAS),
and (3) the fitted GMM distribution with threshold lines.
