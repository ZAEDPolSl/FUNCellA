\title{Function for GMM Decomposition of Pathway Scores}
\usage{
GMMdecomp(X, K = 10, multiply = TRUE, IC = "BIC", parallel = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{data.frame of data enrichment scores (rows: pathways, columns: samples).}

\item{K}{Maximum number of components for GMM decomposition (default: 10).}

\item{multiply}{Logical, whether to scale values by 10 before fitting GMM (default: TRUE).}

\item{IC}{Character string indicating the information criterion to use for model selection.
Options are: \code{"AIC"}, \code{"AICc"}, \code{"BIC"} (default), \code{"ICL-BIC"}, or \code{"LR"}.}

\item{parallel}{Logical indicating whether to perform decomposition in parallel. Default is \code{FALSE}.
(Note: Parallel execution is not yet implemented.)}
}
\value{
A named list of GMM decomposition results for each pathway (row in \code{X}). Each element in the is a list containing:
\itemize{
  \item \code{model}: The fitted GMM model parameters (mixture weights, means, and standard deviations).
  \item \code{threshold}: The decision threshold calculated by the model.
  \item Other diagnostics or intermediate outputs from \code{runGMM} in \code{dpGMM} package.
}
}
\description{
Performs Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) decomposition on pathway enrichment scores across samples.
This function reduces pathway-level data to probabilistic components, which can help detect multimodal activity patterns in gene sets.
}
\details{
This function uses the \pkg{dpGMM} package to fit 1D GMMs on each pathway's expression profile across samples. When \code{multiply = TRUE},
the data is scaled before fitting and rescaled afterward for interpretability. GMMs can help identify active vs. inactive subpopulations or other structured heterogeneity in pathway activity.
