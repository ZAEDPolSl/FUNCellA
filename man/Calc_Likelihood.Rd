\title{Function to calculate Likelihood score in JASMINE pathway enrichment}
\source{
\url{https://github.com/NNoureen/JASMINE}
}
\usage{
Calc_Likelihood(X, g_vec)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix or data.frame with genes/features as rows and samples as columns.
Row names (gene identifiers) must be provided.}

\item{g_vec}{Character vector of gene names representing the gene set/pathway.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of likelihood ratios, one per sample. Higher values indicate stronger
  enrichment of the pathway's genes in the expressed gene set of each sample.
}
\description{
This function computes the likelihood ratio statistic for pathway enrichment,
comparing the expression of genes in the provided gene set  against non-pathway genes
across all samples. The output reflects the relative likelihood that genes in the pathway
are enriched in the non-zero expression profile of each sample.
