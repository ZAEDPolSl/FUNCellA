\title{Determine GMM Threshold Using K-Means Clustering}
\usage{
km_search(params, thrs)
}
\arguments{
\item{params}{A numeric matrix of GMM decomposition parameters. Each row corresponds to one component
(cluster), with columns in the order: mean, standard deviation, and alpha (mixing proportion).}

\item{thrs}{A numeric vector of thresholds produced during GMM decomposition (typically one per component).}
}
\value{
A single numeric value representing the selected GMM threshold.
}
\description{
This function selects an optimal threshold from a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) decomposition,
using k-means clustering on the GMM component parameters (mean, standard deviation, and weight).
It uses silhouette analysis to estimate the optimal number of clusters and then identifies
the most relevant cluster for defining the threshold.
}
\details{
If the number of components is one or two, the function simply returns the maximum threshold.
Otherwise, it scales the parameters, performs k-means clustering, and selects the minimum
threshold corresponding to the cluster with the highest mean.
