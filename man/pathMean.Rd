\title{Wrapper to Mean Pathway Enrichment}
\usage{
pathMean(X, pathway)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix or data.frame with genes/features as rows and samples as columns.
Row names (gene identifiers) must be provided.}

\item{pathway}{A named list of pathways, where each element is a character vector of gene identifiers.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with pathways as rows and samples as columns containing pathway activity scores.
}
\description{
Calculates the mean expression of pathway genes per sample, providing a simple aggregate score.
This function reflects the behavior of \code{AddModuleScore} from the \pkg{Seurat} package.
